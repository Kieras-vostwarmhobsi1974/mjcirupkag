Omg, just finished Black Bag, and what on earth did I watch? 😂 Like, seriously, I’m still trying to process whatever just happened. I started it thinking, Okay, some light drama or thriller,” and it turned into this mind-bending rollercoaster I wasn't ready for. It’s like a buffet of genres, you know what I mean? So much happening!

Anyway, remember you told me to download the movie? Thank you, but now I'm gonna need therapy 😂 The plot twists! It was like the writers thought, Let’s just add ALL the plot twists.” Out of nowhere, you’re like, Oh, now THIS is happening?” Meanwhile, I’m trying to catch my breath and my jaw from hitting the floor.

> The characters though!! Honestly, they were all such hot messes, and I felt everyone’s chaos was on-brand. Like, how do you even write such unpredictable humans? Props to the casting people because those actors totally sold it. Though, side note, the bad guy could’ve been less obvious? Like yeah, we saw that coming from a mile away! But I guess that’s part of the fun, right? Playing detective while I can’t even figure out what’s in my fridge. 😂

I finally managed to watch the movie till the end, and by then I felt like I’d been through a blender of emotions. And don't even get me started on the ending—what was that? It's like they wanted to keep us up all night just thinking. My head's still spinning, but maybe that’s the point. I guess it did its job if I can’t stop blabbing about it now!

Ah, random tech thought: int x = 42; // Why did I just type that? Brain’s a bit scrambled like the movie, I guess.

But now, all jokes aside, thank goodness I watched it though, or I’d be totally missing out on this rollercoaster of crazy. Hit me up if you’re down for a movie night soon!
